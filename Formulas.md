# Formulas

## Averages & Mixtures

- Rule of alligation => if x + a = y - b then x and y were mixed in a ratio of b:a
- If there is P volume of pure liquid and Q is taken out every time and is replaced by pure water n times then the concentration of pure liquid in the solution = (P - Q / P)ⁿ

## Logarithms

- If aˣ = N, then x = logₐ N
- Number of digits in N = Least integer greater than log N
- Number of zeroes after decimal in N = Least integer greater than log N
- Propertiers:
  - logₓ 1 = 0
  - logₓ (ab) = logₓ a + logₓ b
  - logₓ (a/b) = logₓ a - logₓ b
  - logₓ aᵏ = k × logₓ a
  - logₓ y = 1 / logᵧ x
  - logₓ y = log y / log x
  - logₓᵏ a = 1/k × logₓ a
  - xˡᵒᵍˣ ᴺ = N
  - xˡᵒᵍ ʸ = yˡᵒᵍ ˣ

## Sequences & Series

- AM ≥ GM ≥ HM
- Arithmetic Mean = The average of kᵗʰ term from the beginning and the kᵗʰ term from the end
- Geometric Progression:
  - Sum to n terms = a(rⁿ - 1)/(r - 1) = r × Last term - First term / r - 1
  - Geometric Mean = ⁿ√(a₁ × a₂ × a₃ × ... aₙ)
  - S∞ = a / 1 - r
- Harmonic Mean = n / 1/a₁ + 1/a₂ + 1/a₃ + ... + 1/aₙ
- eˣ = 1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + ...
- Summations of some series:
  - Σn = n(n + 1)/2
  - Σn² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6
  - Σn³ = (Σn)²
  - Σ(Even) = n(n + 1)
  - Σ(Odd) = n²

## Ratio, Proportion & Variation

- If a : b :: c : d, then ad = bc
- If a/b = c/d, then a ± b / b = c ± d / d
- If a/b = c/d, then a + b / a - b = c + d / c - d
- If a/b = c/d, then a/b = c - a / d - b
- If a⁄b = c⁄d = e⁄f = ... = k, then k = a ± c ± e ± ... / b ± d ± f ± ...

## Interest

- Compounding done k times a year => in n years A = P × (1 + r/100k)ᵏⁿ
- Infinite compounding => A = P × eⁿʳ/¹⁰⁰
- Instalment = P × r / 100 × {1 - (100 / 100 + r)ⁿ}
- CI - SI when interest being compounded annually, on a sum of P at r% p.a. for n years = P × (r/100)ⁿ

## Time & Distance

- The hands of a clock will form an angle of x° where x° is any angle satisfying 0° < x° < 180° for a total of 44 times in a day.
